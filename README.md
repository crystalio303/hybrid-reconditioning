### hybrid-reconditioning
This project started from talking about the advantages of the Prius. It is a cheap, reliable, green car. Igor Kadulenkov posted a YouTube video with a Google Sheets template of his data. I used that data, cleaned to an extent, to make charts to visualize restoration of battery parts. The hybrid battery reconditioning company, Green Bean, has a mobile service that spans the country and on its website shows an unlabeled graph of performance of cells increasing, then being matched. This is an attempt to find what their measures were.

After this project, I believe there are measures such as SOC, state of charge, that I do not know about that may be the measure that more accurately portrays how cells/modules could be restored for a battery pack that works within range of OEM ones that go for twice the fees. I hope people will be able to share information that can help use hybrids for longer.
